                    Harty and Ojabo were full practice participants on Friday, while Wiggins was 
                    limited for a second straight day. As expected, Cowboys wideout CeeDee Lamb (ankle) 
                    and cornerback Trevon Diggs (foot) are good to go after being on this week's injury report. 
                    Each of the Cowboys' questionable players were limited on Friday.

                        A lengthy injury report for Seatlte. With Walker doubtful, expect Zach Charbonnet to continue 
                        to get the majority of Seattle's carries. De'Von Achane will handle the workload for Miami with 
                        Mostert doubtful. Jeff Wilson should also get some work after averaging 5.2 yards per carry against 
                        Buffalo in Week 2.

                <br style="margin:20px;">
                <p style="padding-top:2px;">
                    With Samuel out and Kittle out, the 49ers will need big outputs from Brandon Aiyuk and Jauan Jennings, 
                    who caught a combined 13 of 19 targets during San Francisco's first two games. Tight end Eric Saubert 
                    is also in line for more targets if Kittle can't go. The NFL's most injured team, the Rams are going 
                    to have to rely more on wideouts Tyler Johnson, Demarcus Robinson, Tutu Atwell and tight end Colby 
                    Parkinson with Kupp not in the lineup. Los Angeles also needs more from its running game, as Kyren 
                    Williams is averaging just 2.5 yards per carry.
